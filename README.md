# Auto Engineer Brake Fix (Railroader)

Makes the AI engineer drive like a person: no brake dragging, fewer wasted coal and water, a smooth throttle,
gentle brake sets for signals, and no creeping past a stop.

All options are on by default, except realistic fuel use, and can be switched off individually in `Settings.xml` in the mod folder (read at start-up).

## Brake fix
In road mode the AI shares one speed setpoint between throttle and brake, with no dead zone. A tiny overspeed applies about 3% train brake, and the AI only releases it once its brake output goes clearly negative, which on a climb at full throttle may never happen: throttle and brake both on for minutes.

While the throttle is open and the train is within a small margin of the AI's own setpoint (default 0.5 mph), the mod releases the brake and blocks new light applications. Real overspeed is left to the AI, so signals, slow orders and downhill control still brake normally.

Test on a 26-car train over 12 miles: throttle+brake overlap fell from 10.3% of the time to 0.4%, with no change in speed.

## Shorter cutoff
The stock AI uses the longest cutoff that reaches peak power, but steam and coal use rise with cutoff while pulling power does not. Above 5 mph the mod picks the shortest cutoff that gives up no more than a set percentage of that power (default 3%), and never a longer one than stock.

Same route and train: coal fell from 4,136 lb to 2,334 lb (-44%) and water by 26% for a few seconds more running time. On climbs of 2.0% or more (adjustable 0.5-5%) the mod hands back to the stock cutoff.

## Throttle smoothing
The stock AI can flip the throttle between 0 and 25% every half second. The mod low-pass filters it (default 1.6 s), limits how fast it can open (full in 5 s) or close, and with "Glide" on moves the lever about 20 times a second between the AI's updates, so it moves smoothly in the cab. When the train is over its setpoint and needs the brake, the throttle closes at once.

## Signals
- **Sight distance** (default 500 m, the game uses 200 m): how far ahead the AI reacts to a signal's aspect.
- **Approach signals**: the game applies the Approach speed limit "right now", which makes the AI brake at full effort. The mod applies it at the signal, so the train slows gradually, and keeps the limit until the next signal is registered so the train doesn't speed up in between.

## Slowing down and stopping
- **Throttle hold**: while slowing for a stop or limit, or just after a brake application, the throttle stays closed unless the train drops clearly below its target. This removes the brake/throttle cycle on gentle downhills and on the way down to a stop.
- **Brake hold**: while slowing for a falling target, a light brake application is not released until the train is clearly under the target, so it builds steadily instead of flickering.
- **Stay stopped**: within 2.5 m of a stop target the AI now holds the stop; the stock AI can treat a train stopped 1-3 m short of a signal as "should be moving" and creep past it.

## Gentle direction-change stop (0.6.0)
Changing direction on a moving train clears the engineer's speed order and targets, so it plans a stop with no distance and brakes at the game's maximum (about 0.29 of a full pipe reduction). While the train is moving with no speed order and nothing ahead to stop for, the mod lowers the brake limit the planner works with to 0.15 (about 13 psi), so it plans a longer, gentler stop. The limit lifts as soon as a new order, target or signal appears, or when the train is almost stopped (under 2 mph). `DirectionStopBrakeLimit` in Settings.xml; 0 turns it off.

## Planner weights (0.6.0)
The auto-engineer's speed controller scores simulated plans. Five multipliers in Settings.xml scale its weights (1 = the game's value): `PlanOverspeedScale`, `PlanUndershootScale`, `PlanUndershootDeadbandScale`, `PlanCeilingScale`, `PlanIndependentUseScale`. For example a higher undershoot scale or a smaller deadband scale makes it hold closer to a limit it is slowing for. All 1 by default.

## Speed limits
- **No power into a reduction**: while a lower limit is in the AI's sight and the train is at or above that speed, the throttle stays closed. Power returns once the train is a mph under the lower limit.
- **Earlier, lighter braking**: a lower limit is treated as starting 10 s of travel sooner (adjustable, 6 s before 2.4.3), and the train brake is released when the speed 3 s ahead reaches the target. Speeds land on the limit instead of under it.
- **Brake with the bleed-down in mind**: a long train's brake cylinders drain slowly after a release and keep slowing the train (roughly psi squared / 60 mph on a 52-car train). The train brake is released once the cylinders will carry the train the rest of the way to the limit (within 0.5 mph), and a new application is held off until they no longer do. Not used near a stop or on a descent. The divisor and margin are adjustable.
- **Coasting band**: a new brake application on a steady limit waits until the train is 1 mph over it.
- Stops are not shifted. In Waypoint and Yard modes the game's own stopping accuracy is kept; the stay-stopped fix is Road mode only.

## Stall guard
The game has no stall check: on a grade the train cannot climb, the AI cycles between full throttle and light braking while rolling back. The mod declares a stall after 10 s of full throttle, under 4 mph, on a climb of 1% or more without gaining speed. It then closes the throttle, holds the brakes (60% train brake while still moving, then 100%; locomotive brake 100%), skips the start-up routine and announces "Stalled on grade". A second trigger covers a train that cannot start at all: under 0.5 mph with the throttle at 50% or more and the brakes off for the same time, on any grade, announced as "Can't start the train". Either hold lasts until you switch the engineer's direction or mode, or switch it off and on.

## Realistic fuel use (experimental, off by default)
Switch it on or off with the "Realistic fuel" toggle in the settings window (Ctrl+F8); it takes effect at once. The steam rate, efficiency and coal scale are edited in `Settings.xml`.

The game's coal and water use rises with speed even though a locomotive's power falls with speed, so fuel per horsepower is about right at 10-20 mph and 1.5-2x too high above 30 mph. With this option, steam = steam rate (default 21.5 lb per indicated hp-hour) x the engine's own power x a cutoff factor, and coal follows from the steam through an evaporation curve (8 lb water per lb coal at light firing, 7 at moderate firing, 5.5 at heavy firing). On the Bryson to Sylva Interchange round trip (EMR 5000, the game's 2-10-2 after the Southern Railway Ss class, about 1,931 short tons, 38.4 miles) this comes to about 23 lb of water and 3.4 lb of coal per indicated horsepower-hour, and about 116 lb of coal and 95 gal of water per 1,000 gross ton-miles (replayed from the logs); the game's own use on the same train was about 36 lb of water and 4.8 lb of coal per indicated horsepower-hour, and 172 lb and 153 gal per 1,000 gross ton-miles, and it ran out of water 3.9 miles short of the end. For comparison: Goss's Purdue tests (*Superheated Steam in Locomotive Service*, 1910) measured 21.6 lb of steam and 2.97 lb of coal per indicated horsepower-hour for a superheated engine at 200 psi in steady running (25.5 and 3.43 saturated), and about 20% more in service with stops; the ICC's Class I road-freight averages were 162 lb of coal per 1,000 gross ton-miles in 1921, 137 in 1926, 125 in 1929 and 111 to 117 from 1937 to 1943 (all routes, locomotives included). Logged use matched the tender within 1%.

By design nothing is burned while the throttle is closed, so a locomotive left idling does not run out of coal and water. A realistic idle burn may come later as a separate "hardcore" option.

## Starting resistance (experimental, off by default)
The game uses the Davis equation for rolling resistance, which is only valid for a moving train: a standing car meets about 1.6 lb per ton, where real plain-bearing cars need 5-10 lb per ton to break away. This option adds a standing-start drag (default 5 lb per ton, fading out exponentially with speed: 37% left at 2.5 mph, about 13% at 5 mph). Standing time (on by default) scales it by how long each car has stood: a car that has just stopped still has oil in its journals and starts at about 40% of the full drag, settling back over about 10 game minutes. It uses the game clock and is not saved, so cars count as fully settled when you load a save.

## Install
Needs Railroader 0.6.0 or later; uses the game's built-in mod loader (Unity Mod Manager is no longer needed).
1. Unzip into `Documents\Railroader\Mods`, so you have `Mods\AutoEngineerBrakeFix\AutoEngineerBrakeFix.dll`, `0Harmony.dll` and `Info.json`.
2. Start the game and enable "Auto Engineer Brake Fix" in the game's mod list.
3. Settings: edit `Mods\AutoEngineerBrakeFix\Settings.xml` (written with the defaults on first start; an old UMM `Settings.xml` can be copied in) and restart the game.

At start-up the mod checks that everything it patches is still in the game. Features whose targets are missing are switched off and the rest keep working; the result is one summary block in the game log (`Player.log`).

## Fuel in fast-forward
The game charges fuel and water once per second of real update, whatever the time scale, so a fast-forwarded trip used about a third of its coal. The mod charges the game time that has actually passed (`FuelFollowsTimeWarp`, on by default; normal speed is unchanged).

## Fusee in fast-forward
Fast-forward switches the main camera off, and the game's fusee code (`Effects.FuseeRenderer.Update`) then throws a `NullReferenceException` on every frame for as long as a fusee is near the train. The mod skips that update while there is no camera (`GuardFuseeCamera`, on by default). It only silences the error; nothing visible changes.

## Coast band (off by default)
Set "Coast band" in the settings window (1 mph is a good start). The engineer then closes the throttle when coasting would hold its speed and it is within the band below its target, or whenever the downhill is still picking the train up, and it waits to brake until it is more than the band over its target, unless a lower limit or a stop ahead needs the brakes. This stops the power-then-brake hunting on downhill and rolling track. Road and Waypoint modes.

## Water stop for Road-mode engineers (off by default)
Switch on "Water stop" in the settings window (Ctrl+F8). When the tender's water drops below the "Stop below" level (30% by default), a Road-mode engineer looks ahead along the route as it is lined for the nearest water column or tower, tells you where it will take water, and slows to the approach speed (20 mph by default) about a mile out, and further near the column so it can stop in the distance left; distances are measured from the tender's water hatch, so a shoved train with cars ahead of the engine is judged correctly. It keeps to your routing until the train is in the column's signal block, then switches to Waypoint mode just long enough to spot the tender under the spout, fills it with the column's own equipment, and goes back to Road mode at the speed and direction it had. Changing its orders yourself cancels the stop. Steam locomotives only; host only. The spotting method follows PrinceOfPluto's Waypoint Queue mod (MIT). Once stopped it checks where the hatch ended up and, if it is not under the spout, moves the train up or back (up to three times, as far as 100 m) before taking water. If the tender still can't be lined up, or no water comes in, the engineer stops at the column and hands over to you: take water by hand and it carries on with its road orders once the tender is full and the spout is up, or give it new orders yourself.

## Legacy speed limits (off by default)
Since 0.6 the game no longer shows the map's per-track speed limits (the old speed boards are removed when a game loads), but the auto engineer still obeys them, so trains slow down for no visible reason ([forum topic 306](https://community.railroadergame.com/t/306)). Switch on "Fix legacy limits" in the settings window: on the mainline (track inside CTC signal blocks, which includes signalled passing sidings) these limits are cleared, so the railroad speed limit, curves and track class decide the speed. On branches, yards and spurs the limits stay and the mod puts up a speed board at each end of every limited stretch. Nothing is saved to the map; switching it off puts the limits back and takes the boards down. The boards are put up by the host.

## Detailed engineer status (off by default)
Switch on "Detailed status" in the settings window. The status line under the auto engineer controls then says what is setting the speed and how far ahead it is, for example "Curve (equipment): 15mph in 420 ft", "Track class 2: 25mph", "Railroad limit: 45mph", "Engine top speed: 41mph" or "Taking water at Whittier (mod): 63%". Hover it for the reasoning (which car's curve rating, what the track alone would allow) and the next targets ahead with their distances. It updates as often as the engineer replans (every half second to three seconds). Distances are in feet and miles; "Metric distances" switches to metres and kilometres. Only the text changes, never the speeds. The tooltip detail is shown on the host.

## Settings window
Press **Ctrl+F8** in game (not at the main menu) to open the settings window: sliders for the brake tap limit, slowing lead, cutoff tolerance and planner weights, a switch for realistic fuel use, a switch for the fuel summary log, and the self-check result per feature. Changes apply immediately and are saved to `Settings.xml`. Everything else is still edited in that file.

## Settings (summary)
Brake fix on/off and overspeed margin; locomotive brake; shorter cutoff on/off, power given up, steep-grade limit; throttle smoothing, glide, close-on-overspeed; throttle hold, brake hold, stay stopped; speed-limit lead and release lead, stall guard; direction-change brake limit and the five planner weight multipliers; realistic fuel use (steam rate, cutoff effect, coal scale); brake tap suppression (`BrakeTapSuppressMph`, 2 by default, off at 0) and the fuel summary log (`LogFuelSummary`; it also records the train's gross tons and coal and water per 1,000 gross ton-miles, and the diagnostic log has a `tons` column); signal sight distance, approach limit at the signal, hold after the signal, approach speed when no signal follows (25 = stock), `CtcDropBlocks` (temporary map workaround for Sylva West eastbound, `signalId:blockId` pairs, empty = off); experimental planning sliders (look-ahead multiplier, assumed braking), both stock by default; diagnostic logger (off by default, writes CSVs under the mod folder's `logs`, including `signals_*.csv` with one line per signal or aspect change and `ctc_dump_*.txt`, a once-per-session list of every CTC block span and signal (read-only); with decision logging on, each row also has the controller's chosen action, its cost, the cost of holding, and the cost of each first action).

## Compatibility
Built for Railroader 0.6.0. Patches the auto-engineer's PID results, its target list and contextual target speed, and the planner's signal-sight distances. Other mods patching the same code may conflict (it has been run alongside WaypointQueue). Disable it in the game's mod list to restore stock behaviour.

## Known limits
Tested on a handful of steam-hauled freight runs, mostly up to 1% grades. Fuel savings depend on the route and train.
